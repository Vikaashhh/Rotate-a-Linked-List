### 🔁 Problem: Rotate a Linked List
### 📌 Level: Medium
### 🧠 Core Focus: Linked List Traversal & Pointer Rearrangement
### 🏁 Status: Problem Solved Successfully

## 🎯 Problem Brief:
Given a singly linked list and an integer k, rotate the list to the right by k nodes. The challenge lies in adjusting pointer references without altering node values, and optimizing for space.

## 💡 Conceptual Approach:
1. The rotation essentially segments the list and reattaches it in a circular manner. The strategy includes:

2. Calculating the length of the list.

3. Determining the effective shift using modulus (k % length).

4. Traversing to the node at position (length - k), then updating pointers to rotate accordingly.

5. This problem is a perfect use case of:

- Edge case checks

- Circular linkage

- In-place modifications

## ✅ Result Overview:
🔹 Test Cases Passed: 1115 / 1115

🔹 Accuracy: 100%

🔹 Attempts: 1 / 1

🔹 Time Taken: 0.94 seconds

🔹 Points Scored: 4 / 4

## 📊 Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n) — Single full traversal + pointer adjustment

- Space Complexity: O(1) — In-place transformation with no extra storage

## 🔄 Why It Matters:
- Pointer manipulation within a linked list is an essential foundation for mastering:

- Real-time scheduling algorithms

- Memory-efficient data processing

- Advanced linked list problems (reordering, merging, detecting cycles)

- It’s not just a problem—it’s a training ground for deep pointer intuition.
